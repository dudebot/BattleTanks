to run the server, just click on classes/server.bat
"	   client		"classes/client.bat

java is retarded, so i wouldnt doubt by the time you see this, the run method (java -cp . BattleTanks.Client) will not work anymore, so yeah...DISREGARD THAT 
	it's a jar file now, so run free!

also, the server console does some stuff, but i kindof forgot what they were, i just know that you can add more or less ai's by plus or minus
also i kindof made a little support for teams, but i never implemented that into the server itself


SERVER:
plus adds an ai
minus gets rid of one
yeah thats it

CLIENT:
wasd are the movement controls
left click will shoot a normal projectile at the mouse location
right click will shoot a special one if you have an item

EDITOR:
left click moves the center of the screen to the mouse
plus zooms in
minus zooms out
right click does whatever is listed to the right of the mouse (delete, add stuff)
middle click activates the edit() function called when creating an object
